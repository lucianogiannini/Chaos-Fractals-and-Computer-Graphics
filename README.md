# Chaos-Fractals-and-Computer-Graphics
For this lab, we’ll use  “Arcadian mathematics”  as our  starting point.  We will touch upon fractal geometry and chaos as well as how computers and technology have helped these fields grow and mature.  In the process, you will see a wonderful symbiotic relationship between mathematics and computer science.
